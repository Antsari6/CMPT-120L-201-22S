Welcome to Sari Sliders

The game is a 2 player game of pong.
each person is assigned their own paddle and keys to control the paddle

Press the key P to start the game
Press R to restart the game

Note: There was a title screen and Hw-to page that were suppose to be linked with this final game code. It is both defined in the game code 

Line 302 is where the defined function exists. The only issue is that i do not know how to link it to the game

If you wish to see what the screen wouldve looked like, remove the hashtag on line 302 to see.
